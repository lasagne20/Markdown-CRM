# Why Choose Markdown CRM?

A comprehensive comparison of Markdown CRM versus traditional cloud-based CRMs.

## 🎯 The Core Problem

Traditional CRMs trap your data in proprietary systems with:
- 💸 **Never-ending subscriptions** ($25-$300+ per user/month)
- 🔒 **Vendor lock-in** (can't easily switch or export)
- 🌐 **Internet dependency** (no offline access)
- 👁️ **Privacy concerns** (your data on their servers)
- ⚙️ **Limited customization** (stuck with their structure)
- 🐌 **Performance issues** (cloud lag, loading screens)

## 💡 The Markdown CRM Solution

Markdown CRM solves these problems by putting **you** in complete control:

### 1. Data Ownership
**Traditional CRM:**
- Data locked in proprietary database
- Export requires special tools
- Risk of data loss if vendor shuts down
- Difficult to access raw data

**Markdown CRM:**
- ✅ Plain text files you own
- ✅ Edit with any text editor
- ✅ Future-proof format (Markdown)
- ✅ Direct access to raw data

---

### 2. Cost
**Traditional CRM:**
- $25-$300 per user per month
- Hidden fees (storage, features, integrations)
- Price increases over time
- Forced upgrades

**Cost for 10 users over 3 years:**
| CRM | Monthly | 3-Year Total |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| Salesforce | $150/user | **$54,000** |
| HubSpot | $90/user | **$32,400** |

        # Write YAML frontmatter
        frontmatter = yaml.dump({
            'fullName': contact['Name'],
            'email': contact['Email'],
            'company': contact['Company']
        })
        
        with open(filename, 'w') as out:
            out.write(f"---\n{frontmatter}---\n\n# {contact['Name']}\n")
```
